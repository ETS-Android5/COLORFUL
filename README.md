# COLORFUL
We are committed to letting everyone see this colorful world
## Test part

- First, we enter the mobile app. In the initial state, we will enter the test interface,

- We don't compromise performance. In order to ensure accuracy, 3000 digital images for measurement are built in

- Not only the type of color barrier is determined, but also the degree of color barrier is determined to thousands of grades

- Here we take red green blindness as an example

## Main interface

- Then let's go to the main interface

- The design is very simple and has few colors. The purpose is to hope that the app everyone sees is the same clear and recognizable state

- That goes into the first feature color enhancement

## Color enhancement

- It's not a function, it's more a guide,

- ##  we hope users can access the auxiliary functions more conveniently

- When this function is enabled, the entire phone interface will become the color after correction or mapping

- This is very similar to our own color filter, but we do more than that

## Color restoration

- Color blind patients have their own color cognitive system

- We conducted a survey and collected hundreds of questionnaires from various colleges and universities,

- I don't necessarily like the corrected color, (I'm used to my own color system and can distinguish)

- It's just a tool to use when you want to use it

- Color restoration can be taken or selected from photo albums for very accurate color correction or mapping

- For example, I have now selected a photo with a very beautiful color, but color blind patients may not be able to see it.

- When we click the switch, we can see that the photos have been corrected and changed

- I think it's very appropriate to use this function on a photo in the circle of friends that can't distinguish colors

## Real time restore

- Of course, with static, we also have real- time.

- In the required scenario, the color barrier user can open the restore function.

- Now I will switch the perspective of all teachers to the state of color blindness and deeply experience the application of this mode

- There are many colors in my room now, and you can't see all the colors at this time

- When I started real- time restoration, indeed, during the first experience, our color weak students showed a very surprised expression

## Sketchpad

- Then there is the function of colorful painting

- We believe that everyone has an artist in his heart, and we never think that the world known by color disabled people is wrong. We respect every existence

- We can draw freely on the drawing board, add the drawing board (click + drawing board), and select our favorite color (drawing)

- Without worrying about communication

- Click share to get three different pictures

- Primitive

- After correction (show the color impaired people how their paintings look in the eyes of normal people)

- After weakening (show normal people what their eyes look like)

- -  - -  - - 

The above is the content of colorfu app, but we do more than that (slide to GitHub and open the web page in advance)

- -  - -  - - 

## We launched the colorful open source project and created a website. We hope to rely on the open source community,

- Call on more developers to help color barrier people, so that they can enjoy the color of the Internet age like us

## At the same time, it empowers the follow- up development of our products and has more forms

- We hope that colorful will not only be applied to mobile phones themselves

## We have taken a step and applied it to our colorful drawing board. We can draw freely and even shoot professionally with the help of colorfur technology

- In the era when everyone is we media, we hope to let the color disabled people also record their beauty

- Our product forms will become more diverse. What I hold in my hand is a Sony A7 full frame camera that can shoot 10 bit color depth,

- Using colorful technology, we can realize the camera's internal output and color compensation

## In the future, our forms will be more diversified. We are developing camera kits for iPhone and Android devices,

- Use 5g Wi Fi to achieve high- quality wireless image transmission

- When the bit rate allows, we will achieve 1080p 10bit 4:2:0 correction of external recording

## We are not developing for the normal people of color vision, nor for the biased people of color blindness. We hope everyone has the right to appreciate and exchange this colorful world. My exhibition is over
